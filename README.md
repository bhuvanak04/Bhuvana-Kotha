## About Me
I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Data Science (Information Systems minor) at UC Riverside (’26).  
I'm interested in turning raw data into actionable insights and production‑ready ML models.  
Currently diving deeper into model fairness (AIF360) and scalable deployments via the BreakThrough Tech AI Program.

## 🔗 Featured Projects

### • [world-happiness-prediction](https://github.com/bhuvanak04/world-happiness-prediction)
End‑to‑end ML pipeline predicting World Happiness scores—data cleaning, feature engineering (162 country dummies), exploratory analysis, and model comparison (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting). Achieved baseline RMSE of 0.388 (R²≈0.88) and improved ensemble performance via 5‑fold CV.

### • [pizza-store-sql-program](https://github.com/bhuvanak04/PizzaStore-SQL-Program)
Role‑based Java/PLpgSQL pizza‑ordering system with automated audit logging (triggers & stored procedures), optimized indexing for 50% faster queries, and secure access control for customers, staff, and admins.

### • [flight-delay-analysis](https://github.com/bhuvanak04/Flight-Delay-Analysis)
Analyzed 336,776 NYC flight records: cleaned missing data, performed time‑series and EDA, and quantified seasonal delay trends—summer delays ↑30%, precipitation adds ~4 min delay/inch.
